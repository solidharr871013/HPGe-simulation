     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================
     -- created in Nov. 20th, by Micheal Zhang
     for HPGe simulation, with the GDML method. Geometry Create
     with FreeCAD. the type of the HPGe is the coaxial with a copper cold-finger.
     a lead shielding chamber is included in the simulation, with a copper shielding 
     layer and a plastic shielding layer. the Dead layers are included, but the dead layers
     material are set as Germanium, considering with Lithium and Boron atomic ratio is 
     pretty low.
